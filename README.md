# üèõÔ∏è US Debt Tracker Project <br>

The US Debt Tracker Project is a comprehensive analysis of US debt data, utilizing advanced Excel techniques to explore trends, identify patterns, and forecast future scenarios. The project delivers key insights into the debt held by the public, intragovernmental holdings, and total public debt outstanding.

## üìÇ Project Workflow

<h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Data Preparation</h3>

Transforming raw data into an analyzable format was the first step. Key preparation processes included:<br>
	‚Ä¢	Transpose Data: Converted columns into rows for better readability and manipulation.<br>
	‚Ä¢	Filter Blank Values: Removed rows with missing data to ensure consistency.<br>
	‚Ä¢	Replace Nulls: Used Find & Replace (Ctrl+H) to remove ‚Äúnull‚Äù entries.<br>
	‚Ä¢	Convert Scientific Notation: Formatted numbers from scientific notation to standard n<br>umeric format.<br>
	‚Ä¢	Extract Year-End Dates: Filtered the date column to keep only the last days of each year.<br><br>
 
 <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Data Manipulation Techniques</h3>

Several advanced Excel functions and tools were employed to process and analyze the data:<br><br>
	‚Ä¢	Pivot Tables:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to summarize and analyze large datasets quickly.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created yearly summaries for the percentage increase in public debt, intragovernmental holdings, and total debt.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grouped data by months to calculate average monthly debts.<br>
	‚Ä¢	Advanced Filtering:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied custom filters to isolate key trends, such as year-end totals or specific monthly patterns.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracted records corresponding to significant spikes or anomalies for closer inspection.<br><br>
	‚Ä¢	Conditional Formatting:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlighted spikes in debt increase during specific months or years.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color-coded year-over-year trends for easier visualization.<br><br>
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic Ranges: <br>
 			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leveraged named ranges to automate chart updates when data changes.<br><br>

## üìä Key Analysis & Findings

1. Yearly Debt Percentage Increase<br>

	‚Ä¢	Technique:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used Pivot Tables to calculate yearly percentage changes.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized the trends using a multi-series line chart.<br><br>
	‚Ä¢	Insight:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2012‚Äì2019, the average yearly increase in public debt was ~5%.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp spike in 2020 (~25% increase) was observed, likely due to COVID-19 pandemic policies.<br><br>

2. Monthly Average Total Debts<br>

	‚Ä¢	Technique:
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used grouped Pivot Tables to calculate monthly averages across all years.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Represented findings in a bar chart.<br><br>
	‚Ä¢	Insight:
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest increases: January, February, November, and December (holiday spending and tax-related activities).<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowest increases: April, May, June, and July (typically less fiscal activity).<br><br>

3. Projected Publicly Held Debt<br>

	‚Ä¢	Technique:
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated debt projections based on historical trends using Excel‚Äôs Forecast Sheet and linear regression models.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized growth using a line chart for 2023‚Äì2027.<br><br>
	‚Ä¢	Insight:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt rose from $6 trillion to $17 trillion between 2008 and 2019.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projected to reach $33 trillion by 2027.<br><br>


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques Used<br>
